###  Monolithic Artitecture vs Microservices Artitecture 
Monolithic  - Overload IDE, Scaling is very hard [Product, Billing, Account,Payment]       
Microservices - All the disadvantages of monolithic are advantage of microservices. 


1) Loosely coupled Right (tick ) Less Dependent on any other Service. 

   -  Latency increases   
[MS2---------->MS1] Latency increases when microservices are not lossely coupled.      

Lossely coupled --> Scaling one service without impacting other service.    
2) Monitoring become difficult.    
3) Transaction Management   (Difficult)
Maintaining a legacy application is cumbersome and often leads to additional work because of multiple reasons -

- Lack of Unit Tests.      
- Violation of Single Responsibility Principle.       
- High Complexity leads to more time spent in maintenance activities.       
- Inability to scale individual components to meet increased demand.     
- Tight coupling between components makes it difficult to deploy regularly.     
- Technical Debt accumulated over time and makes future development difficult.    

### Moving from Monolithic Artitecture to Microservices Artitecture

### PHASES OF MICROSERVICES 
#### 1. Decomposition Pattern   
- > By Business Functionality / Capability 
- > By SubDomain 
  
##### (i) By Business functionality / Capability 
Challenge ->   Should have knowledge of functionality    
**Online Order Application**      
a) _Order Management_      
OrderID , Order Name, Location, Delivery , Agent assigned       
b) _Product Management_  Inventory Management        
c) _Account Management_  IsItemBuild, Amount TID, 
d) _Login_ 
e) _Billing_ 
f) _Payment_ 
##### (ii) By SubDomain (Domain Driven Design)            
Order Management                     -----> [     ]
                                     -----> [     ] 
                                     -----> [     ] 


Payment User1<----->User2    
a) forward Domain   
b) Backward Domain      

### Strangler Pattern [Refactoring to Microservices] 
If there is any issue comes in Microservice we can switch back to the traffic to monolithic. This flow can be controlled by controller

#### 2. Database Management in Microservices.
- > Database per service.       
- > Database shared.

##### SAGA Pattern 
Sequence of Local Transactions 
![Saga Pattern](L03SAgaPattern.png)
Order will be places only when all events will success. otherwise it will fail. Either all will success or none.

Transform and Eliminate Pattern
![Tranform&Eliminate](L03Tranfrom&EliminatePattern.png)

SAGA Pattern: 
Each business transaction which spans multiple microservices are split into microservice specific local transactions, and they are executed in a sequence to complete the business workflow. It is called Saga. It can be implemented in 2 ways.

Choreography approach                     
Orchestration approach                   
![Choreography&Orchestration](ChoreoGraphy&OrchestratorPattern.png)
- Choreography -- Each ms that is part of transaction publishes an event that is processed by next MS.  
[choreography](choreography.png)
This approach has many advantages.    
There is no service dependency. payment-service & inventory-services do not have to be up and running always.               
Loose coupling              
Horizontal scaling         
Fault tolerant         

The business workflow is implemented as shown here.

order-services receives a POST request for a new order                
It places an order request in the DB in the ORDER_CREATED state and raises an event                
payment-service listens to the event, confirms about the credit reservation              
inventory-service also listens to the order-event and conforms the inventory reservation            
order-service fulfills order or rejects the order based on the credit & inventory reservation status.           

- Orchestration -- A single orchestrator is responsible for managing the overall transaction status.

In this pattern, we will have an orchestrator, a separate service, which will be coordinating all the transactions among all the Microservices. If things are fine, it makes the order-request as complete, otherwise marks that as cancelled.

Each microservice which will be coordinated by orchestrator is expected to have at least 2 endpoints for each entity! One is deducting and other one is for resetting the transaction.

Letâ€™s see how we could implement this. Our sample architecture will be more or less like this.!

-- > In this demo, communication between orchestrator and other services would be a simple HTTP in a non-blocking asynchronous way to make this stateless.               
-- > We can also use Kafka topics for this communication. For that we have to use scatter/gather pattern which is more of a stateful style.

#### 3. Communication 
- > API 
- > Events 

#### 4. Integration 
- > API Gateway
